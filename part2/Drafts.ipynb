    "I used the doubly-constrained model to compute the flows, which takes into account both the production (origin) and attraction (destination) constraints of the transportation system. This is crucial for accurately modeling transportation demand and supply. I created a formula for the model using the variables \"flows\", \"station_destination\", \"station_origin\", and \"log_distance\", and set the intercept to zero with \"-1\". Then, I fitted the model using a Poisson regression and calculated the goodness-of-fit.\n",

    "The table shows estimated passenger flows (SIM_est_exp) between stations. The highest estimated flow is from Waterloo to Bank and Monument at 4,557 people, with high flows expected between stations like Stratford and Liverpool Street, which are important for tourist attractions, business and financial centers, and transport hubs. These stations are also major interchange points, which requires handling high passenger traffic. Similarly, high estimated flows between Stratford and Canary Wharf can be attributed to the large number of commuters traveling between these two areas. Overall, the estimates seem reasonable and consistent with prior knowledge of the network."

The predicted flows under this scenario are calculated using the adjusted jobsnew field and the Ai and Bj fields from the previous model, as well as the calibrated beta parameter. To conserve the total number of commuters, the predicted flows are scaled by a factor, k, which is equal to the ratio of the total observed flows to the total predicted flows from scenario A.

These changes may be due to changes in travel patterns and destinations as a result of job losses, which have affected footfall between Tube stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more in-depth analysis of the scenario A results shows that the predicted increases in passenger flow are predominantly concentrated in the central and east London areas, where many of the job losses are expected to occur. This suggests that the reduction in job opportunities may lead to changes in commuting patterns, with commuters from these areas seeking employment opportunities elsewhere. The large increase in passenger flow between Waterloo and Bank and Monument stations may also be due to the fact that these stations are major interchange stations on the Waterloo & City and Northern lines, which are important transport links for commuters travelling to the financial district.\n",

For example, if there is too much of an increase in footfall at some Underground stations, this could lead to overcrowding at these stations, affecting the efficiency and safety of Underground operations. In addition, if the Tube network is unable to adapt to these changes, adjustments and improvements may be required to ensure the resilience and sustainability of the network."
